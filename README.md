It is 2-player game.

Its layout consists of a 4x4 or 6x6 grid of cells which can be set to either white or black.

Initially,a 2x2 area at the center of the grid is filled with black(2 cells) and white(2 cells).
Black plays first followed by White and so on.

Whenever one or more black cells are trapped between 2 white cells (vertically,horizontally and/or diagonally),all of them are converted to white and vice versa.

There are 2 counters for black and white (each preset to 2) at the bottom of the grid which count the current number of black cells and white cells,respectively.
